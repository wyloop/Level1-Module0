text: "\n\n# Houses\n\n1. Have a robot start on the left side of the window near the\
  \ bottom.\n\n2. Draw a flat-topped house of height 100 with grass after it (see\
  \ picture).\n\n3. Extract the piece of code that draws the house into a method.\
  \ Draw 10 houses.\n\n4. Change the method to take (int height) as a parameter. Draw\
  \ 9 houses of different heights\n\n5. Make the method take a String instead of an\
  \ int.\n\n6. Make the method take a color as well as a height. The houses are drawn\
  \ in that color.\n\n[optional] Set the scene to night by setting the background\
  \ to black\n\n7. Give the houses peaked roofs\n\n8. Extract that roof code into\
  \ a method \u201CdrawPointyRoof\u201D and create a new method: \u201CdrawFlatRoof\u201D\
  .\n\n9. Make large houses have flat roofs\n\n\n"
