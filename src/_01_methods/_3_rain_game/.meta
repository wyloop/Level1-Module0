text: "\n\n# Rain Game\n\n1. Start a new sketch with draw, setup, and settings methods.\n\
  \n2. Set your canvas size in the settings() method\n```\n    size(width, height)\n\
  ```\nand your background color in the draw method\n```\n    background(red, green,\
  \ blue)\n```\n3. Draw a raindrop at the top of the screen in the draw() method.\n\
  ```\n\n    fill(red, green, blue);\n    stroke(red, green, blue);\n    ellipse(x,\
  \ y, width, height);\n```\n4. Make the rain fall down the screen.\nHint: make a\
  \ variable for the raindrop's Y position and change it in the draw method.\n5. When\
  \ the rain falls off the bottom of the canvas, start a new rain drop falling from\
  \ the top.\n6.  Make the rain start at a random position (X position) at the top.\
  \ This code will give you a random number between 0 and the width of your sketch.\n\
  ```\n      int randomNumber = (int) random(width);\n```\n7. Draw a bucket at the\
  \ bottom of the screen.\n```\n        rect(int x, int y, int width, int height);\n\
  ```\n8. Make the bucket move over and back with the mouse. Hint: mouseX\n9. Add\
  \ an int variable to hold the score (above the setup method). If the rain falls\
  \ in the bucket increase the score by 1. If it doesn\u2019t, decrease the score\
  \ by 1, but don\u2019t let the score go negative. Figure it out by yourself or use\
  \ this method\u2026\n\nvoid checkCatch(int x){\nif (x > mouseX && x < mouseX+100)\n\
  score++;\nelse if (score > 0)\nscore--;\nprintln(\"Your score is now: \" + score);\n\
  }\n\n10. Print the score on the screen.\n\nfill(0, 0, 0);\ntextSize(16);\ntext(\"\
  Score: \" + score, 20, 20);\n\n\n"
