  # Duelling Buttons


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/duellingButtons.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  We are going to use GUI components to make demanding buttons that will compete in
  a duel for the uer''s attention. When the user clicks on one button, the other button
  will demand to be clicked on!


  ## Steps:


  1. A JFrame, JPanel, and two JButtons have already been created. You set the text
  of both buttons to "Click Me". When you pack the JFrame and run the program, it
  should look like this:

  2. Add this ActionListener to both buttons. Then modify the actionPerformed() method
  to make the buttons change their text and size when the user clicks (follow instructions
  in the code).
