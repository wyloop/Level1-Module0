# Fortune Cookie

Goal: Make a Swing program from scratch.
The program will have a window (frame) with a button that gives one of five random fortunes when clicked.
1. Make a FortuneCookie class, with a showButton() method like the one below:

public class FortuneCookie {
public void showButton() {
System.out.println("Button clicked");
}
}

2. Now make a runner class to run the code above, like the one below:

public class FortuneCookieRunner {
public static void main(String[] args) {
new FortuneCookie().showButton();
}
}

3. Now change the showButton() method in Step 1, to make a JFrame and get it to show up when you run the program. Hint:
frame.setVisible(true);

4. Make a JButton and add it to the JFrame.
JButton button = new JButton();
frame.add(button);
frame.pack();

5. The next 4 steps make a pop-up appear that says, “Woohoo” when the button is clicked

a. Add an action listener to the button:
button.addActionListener(this);

b. Have your class implement ActionListener [use Eclipse quick fix]

c. Add the unimplemented methods [use Eclipse quick fix]

d. Put a JOptionPane pop-up inside the actionPerformed() method that says "Woohoo".

6. Generate a random number between 0 and 4:
int rand = new Random().nextInt(5);
7. Depending on which random number, show one of the five fortunes.

[optional] 8. Run other student's programs to receive fortunes from them.
